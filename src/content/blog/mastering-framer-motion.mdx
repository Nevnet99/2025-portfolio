# Mastering Animation with Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a production-ready motion library for React that makes creating animations a breeze. Let's explore how to create stunning animations that enhance user experience.

## The Basics

Framer Motion provides a simple API for creating animations:

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

function AnimatedCard() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
    >
      Hello, Animation!
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

## Advanced Animation Techniques

### Gesture Animations

Framer Motion makes it easy to add gesture-based animations:

```jsx
<motion.div
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
>
  Interactive Element
</motion.div>
```

### Variants

Using variants helps organize complex animations:

```jsx
const container = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  show: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1
    }
  }
}

const item = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  show: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `layoutId` for smooth transitions
2. Implement exit animations
3. Optimize performance with `useReducedMotion`

## Conclusion

Framer Motion provides the tools needed to create polished, professional animations that enhance user experience without compromising performance.

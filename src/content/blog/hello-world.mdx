# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post written in MDX. This is a powerful way to write content that combines markdown with React components.

## Why MDX?

MDX allows you to:
1. Write content in markdown
2. Use React components inline
3. Create interactive blog posts
4. Style your content with CSS

## Example Component

Here's an example of using a custom React component in MDX:

export const Highlight = ({ children }) => (
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: '#ffeb3b', padding: '0 4px' }}>
    {children}
  </span>
)

This is a sentence with a <Highlight>highlighted word</Highlight>!

## Code Examples

```typescript
// You can include syntax-highlighted code blocks
const greeting = 'Hello, World!'
console.log(greeting)
```
